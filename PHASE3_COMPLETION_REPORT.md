# Phase 3: Backend Actions Updates - Completion Report

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive backend server actions to support the assignee system, including milestone assignments, task visibility controls, and helper functions for managing user assignments. All actions include proper role-based access control and automatic visibility management.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Milestone Actions Enhanced (`app/actions/milestones.ts`)

#### A. getMilestones Function
```typescript
// Enhanced to include assignee information
.select(`
  *,
  assignee:profiles!assignee_id(
    id, email, full_name, avatar_url, role
  ),
  tasks(
    id, title, status, priority, position, visibility,
    assigned_to, assigned_to_profile:profiles!assigned_to(...)
  )
`)
```
- ✅ Returns milestone assignee details
- ✅ Includes task visibility information
- ✅ Maintains role-based access control

#### B. createMilestone Function
- ✅ Added `assignee_id` parameter
- ✅ Validates assignee is admin or team_member
- ✅ Rejects client assignees with clear error
- ✅ Returns created milestone with assignee details

#### C. updateMilestone Function
- ✅ Added `assignee_id` to updatable fields
- ✅ Validates role when changing assignee
- ✅ Allows null assignee (unassignment)
- ✅ Returns updated milestone with assignee details

### 2. Task Actions Enhanced (`app/actions/tasks.ts`)

#### A. createTask Function
```typescript
// Enhanced with visibility parameter
export async function createTask(data: {
  // ... existing fields
  visibility?: 'internal' | 'client'
})
```
- ✅ Added `visibility` parameter
- ✅ Auto-sets visibility to 'client' when assigning to client user
- ✅ Defaults to 'internal' for team assignments
- ✅ Respects explicit visibility setting

#### B. updateTask Function

- ✅ Auto-adjusts visibility based on assignee role
- ✅ Maintains data consistency

#### C. NEW: assignTask Function
```typescript
export async function assignTask(
  taskId: string,
  assigneeId: string | null,
  visibility?: 'internal' | 'client'
)
```
**Features:**
- Assigns or unassigns tasks
- Auto-determines visibility based on assignee role
- Allows explicit visibility override
- Sends notifications on assignment change
- Full error handling and validation

#### D. NEW: bulkAssignTasks Function
```typescript
export async function bulkAssignTasks(
  taskIds: string[],
  assigneeId: string | null,
  visibility?: 'internal' | 'client'
)
```
**Features:**
- Assigns multiple tasks in one operation
- Consistent visibility handling
- Batch path revalidation
- Performance optimized

#### E. NEW: getClientTasks Function
```typescript
export async function getClientTasks(clientId?: string)
```
**Features:**
- Returns tasks visible to specific client
- Filters by assignment OR visibility
- Includes milestone and service context
- Respects service boundaries

### 3. Assignment Helper Functions (`app/actions/assignments.ts`)

#### A. getAssignableUsers Function
```typescript
export async function getAssignableUsers(
  serviceId: string,
  includeClient: boolean = false
)
```
**Features:**
- Returns users eligible for task assignment
- Optional client inclusion for tasks
- Role-based filtering
- Service access validation

#### B. getAssignableUsersForMilestone Function
**Features:**
- Returns only admin/team members
- Specifically for milestone assignment
- Sorted by role and name
- Type-safe return values

#### C. getServiceAssignmentSummary Function
**Features:**
- Complete assignment overview for a service
- Counts assigned/unassigned items
- Lists all assignees
- Tracks client-visible tasks

#### D. getUserAssignments Function
**Features:**
- Returns all items assigned to a user
- Includes both milestones and tasks
- Filters based on user role
- Sorted by due date

#### E. transferAssignments Function
**Features:**
- Bulk transfer between users
- Optional inclusion of completed items
- Admin-only operation
- Maintains data integrity

### 4. Role-Based Access Control

#### Milestone Assignment Rules
| Role | Can Assign To | Can Be Assigned |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Admin | Admin/Team | ✅ Yes |
| Team | Admin/Team | ✅ Yes |
| Client | ❌ No | ❌ No |

#### Task Assignment Rules
| Role | Can Assign To | Can Be Assigned | Visibility |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| Admin | Anyone | ✅ Yes | Any |
| Team | Anyone | ✅ Yes | Any |
| Client | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Client only |

### 5. Automatic Behaviors

#### Visibility Auto-Management
1. **Task assigned to client** → visibility = 'client'
2. **Task assigned to team/admin** → visibility = 'internal'
3. **Task unassigned** → visibility = 'internal'
4. **Explicit visibility** → Overrides auto-detection

#### Validation Chain
1. User authentication check
2. Role permission verification
3. Service access validation
4. Assignee role validation (for milestones)
5. Data consistency checks

### 6. Testing & Verification

#### Database Constraints
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Milestone assignee trigger exists | ✅ Pass |
| No client milestone assignments | ✅ Pass |
| Task visibility values valid | ✅ Pass |
| Indexes created | ✅ Pass |

#### RLS Policies Active
- ✅ "Admin and team can manage all tasks"
- ✅ "Admin and team can view all tasks"
- ✅ "Clients can view assigned or visible tasks"
- ✅ "Clients can update their assigned tasks"
- ✅ "Admin and team can manage all milestones"
- ✅ "Clients can view milestones in their services"

#### Performance Optimization
- ✅ `idx_milestones_assignee` - Fast assignee lookups
- ✅ `idx_tasks_visibility` - Efficient visibility filtering
- ✅ `idx_tasks_visibility_assigned` - Combined query optimization

### 7. Error Handling

#### Clear Error Messages
- "Milestone assignee must be an admin or team member"
- "Invalid assignee"
- "Task not found"
- "You do not have access to this service"
- "User must have one of these roles: admin, team_member"

#### Graceful Failures
- Invalid IDs return proper errors
- Missing data handled safely
- Permission denials are explicit
- Database errors properly caught

### 8. Code Quality Improvements

#### TypeScript Compatibility
- Fixed Set iteration for ES5 compatibility
- Used `Array.from()` instead of spread operator
- Proper type annotations throughout
- No compilation errors

#### Code Organization
- Logical function grouping
- Consistent naming conventions
- Clear parameter types
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments

### 9. Files Modified/Created

   - Added assignee support to all functions
   - Enhanced query selections
   - Added role validation

2. **app/actions/tasks.ts**

   - Validates data integrity

### 10. Integration Points

#### Ready for UI Implementation
All backend actions are ready to be consumed by:
- Milestone edit dialogs
- Task assignment popovers
- Bulk assignment tools
- User assignment views
- Client task lists

#### API Consistency
All functions follow consistent patterns:
- Return `{ data }` or `{ error }`
- Include success messages
- Revalidate affected paths
- Handle permissions uniformly

## Security Verification

### Access Control Matrix
| Action | Admin | Team | Client |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| Assign milestone | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Assign task | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View all tasks | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View assigned tasks | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View client tasks | ✅ | ✅ | ✅* |
| Update task status | ✅ | ✅ | ✅* |

*Client can only affect their own assigned tasks

### Data Isolation
- ✅ Clients cannot see internal tasks
- ✅ Service boundaries enforced
- ✅ Role restrictions at database level
- ✅ RLS policies prevent bypassing

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Indexed foreign keys for joins
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Selective data fetching
- Batch operations where possible

### Caching Strategy
- Path revalidation on updates
- Minimal database round trips
- Efficient relation loading
- Optimized for common access patterns

## Migration Safety

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- Default values prevent breaks
- Nullable fields for gradual adoption
- No breaking changes to APIs

### Rollback Capability
Server actions can be reverted without database changes since:
- Database schema already updated (Phase 1)
- Types already defined (Phase 2)
- No destructive operations

## Next Steps

Ready for **Phase 4: Assignment UI Components**:
- Assignee selector component
- Assignee avatar component
- Task card assignment UI
- Milestone edit dialog
- Bulk assignment interface
