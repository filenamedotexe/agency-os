-- Step 2.2: Create Storage Policies for Chat Attachments
-- This secures the chat-attachments bucket so users can only access appropriate files

-- First, check existing policies on storage.objects for chat-attachments bucket
SELECT

    cmd,
    permissive,

-- ============================================
-- STORAGE OBJECT POLICIES FOR CHAT-ATTACHMENTS
-- ============================================

-- Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload attachments to their own folder
-- File structure: user_id/conversation_id/filename
-- Only allows uploads if the folder path starts with the user's ID
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload attachments" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'chat-attachments' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1] AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

-- Policy 2: Allow users to view attachments in conversations they participate in
-- This is more permissive for now - we'll secure it further at the application level
-- Users can view any file in the chat-attachments bucket if they're authenticated
CREATE POLICY "Users can view attachments" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'chat-attachments' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

-- Policy 3: Allow users to delete their own attachments
-- Users can only delete files in folders that start with their user ID
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own attachments" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'chat-attachments' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1] AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

-- Policy 4: Allow service role to manage all attachments (for system operations)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage all attachments" ON storage.objects
